# URC Lessons Learned
This document outlines the mistakes made when building a rover and competing in URC.

## General
* If it is not tested __it will not work__. Test absolutely everything as early as possible in the most accurate way. 

## Mechanical
* Loctite or threadfasten everything! Every. Single. Thing. [Loctite User Guide](http://www.loctite.com.au/aue/content_data/133403_LT_4985_Threadlocking_Users_Guide.pdf)

## Electrical
* Radios are hard, and caused our failure in 2016, give them the time they deserve.
* SMA connectors are not meant for repeated cycles (external Ebox connectors), they will fail and cause weird issues with your RF system. Use something like a BNC instead.

## Software
* Github is your friend.

## Science
* URC likes it when you talk about rocks.
* Simple presentations are better.

## Team Structure / Leadership
* People are volunteers, you (unfortunatly) cannot treat them like employees.
* People bail, stuff happens, be prepared to pick up the slack.

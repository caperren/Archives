\section{Problems / Solutions}
\subsection{Time Scheduling}
Due to the busy schedules of our group members, the client, and our TA, it was initially hard finding times to schedule meetings.
We solved this problem very simply by changing to remote, virtual meetings, which provided enough flexibility for all parties to find times that overlapped. 

\subsection{Requirements Changes}
As the core design of the Rover is changing on a regular basis, maintaining a solid foundation of requirements has, at times, been difficult.
Some expectations of the final design of the ground station software have not changed, but others like the user input methods have changed two or three times over the course of the term.
This is ultimately a minimal problem that can be easily handled by making sure we keep our requirements documentation updated as these changes are made.

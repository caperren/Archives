Throughout this document, we have covered the design considerations, component design, and GUI design for the Mars Rover ground station software that our team will be implementing.
By following the design guidelines laid out in this document over the next five months, we are confident that our team will be able to accomplish the desired state of the Mars Rover ground station software.
In doing so, not only will we be delivering to our client a useful and robust front-end to the Mars Rover for the competition next June, but also hopefully a base to work off of for many years into the future.

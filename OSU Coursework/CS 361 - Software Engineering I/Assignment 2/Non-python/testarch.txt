Compared to the original kwic, the testing version of kwic is quite different. The focus of this version was to pull out
much of the code from the main into functions so that sensitive portions could be easily tested separately, as well as
be changed more easily. From an architectural point of view, the original kwic is very much a traditional black box
approach. Data and flags in, one tiny function call used for alphabetization (as I had trouble with it and needed to
pull it out), and the final data came out. The testing version on the other hand is approximately 25% longer in terms of
pure code length, and is split into ten separate functions rather than the two for the original kwic. By splitting the
core features of the kwic system into these functions, it made testing the development of the code that much easier.
Rather than having to run through all the code up to the point I wanted to test, I could simply only call the functions
for features I was actively testing. Of course, adding all these extra function calls did affect performance slightly,
though not as much as I was expecting. This version is only marginally slower than the baseline implementation. I also
considering adding a flag to kwic that would enable debugging print statements, but I decided against it as (at least
in my personal experience) adding tons of print statements isn't specifically always helpful. Generally, you only need
printing for a particular section of code, which could easily be manually added now that the important parts of the code
are broken out.

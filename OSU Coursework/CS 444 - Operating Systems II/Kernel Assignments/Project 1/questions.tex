\section{Questions}
\subsection{Point of Assignment}
The point of this assignment was to make sure that our group could properly get the course's development environment up and running. Additionally, it gave us initial experience with using qemu, as that will be a core tool used during this class. Setting up the git repository also was needed to ensure both the instructors and our group can keep track of changes made to the kernel as we work on assignments over the term. 

\subsection{Problem Approach}
We approached this problem by systematically following the directions on the homework page, and making adjustments as necessary to fit our particular development environment. Where needed, we also looked up documentation through man pages and the internet.

\subsection{Correctness}
We know that the end result was correct as we were able to successfully compile the kernel and boot the kernel in the emulator.

\subsection{What Was Learned}
We learned how to set up the environment needed to both build and run a custom modified linux kernel in a virtual machine.
